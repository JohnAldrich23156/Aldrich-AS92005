      <h2>Facts about Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
      <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
        <li>Jewelled geckos have unique patterns on their skin which varies from each different species.</li>
        <li>Jewelled geckos give birth to live young unlike most other gecko species.</li>
        <li>Jewelled geckos have excellent climbing abilities due to the special construction of their toe pads and prehensile tails.</li>
        <li>Jewelled geckos are Diurnal, which means that they tend to spend most of their time during the day hours.</li>
        <li>Jewelled geckos are omnivorous, this means that their diet consists of invertebrates like insects, fruit and nectar.</li>

      <h2>The Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
      <p>The Jewelled geckos are a group of gecko species endemic to the south island of New Zealand in indigenous forests, shrublands, and tussock grasslands. These geckos tend to be around 72-85mm SVL (Snout-Vent Length) with their tails being longer than their SVL. Some of these individuals can grow up to 90mm SVL with total lengths being recorded p to 187mm, although on average they grow up around 155-170mm. Jewelled geckos have an omnivorous diet which consists of invertebrates like insects, honey, nectar and berries from Coprosma.</p>
      <p>Jewelled geckos have a large population spread around in areas like Banks Peninsula, Canterbury Plains, South Canterbury, Mackenzie Country, regions in Otago and Foveaux Strait. With a diverse population, there are also distinct features on the geckos native to that region with various coloured patterns (either yellow or white) outlined with black or dark brown lines. Some like those in Cantebury have a brown colour for their males with females having a grey-brown colouration on their sides.</p>
      <p>A life span of a Jewelled gecko in the wilderness would have a minimum life expectancy of 14-15. With captive individuals however, the gecko's life expectancy increases to 20-25 years and could even reach in excess of 35 years. The geckos are a terrestrial or arboreal species that inhabit indigenous forests like Beech forests, shrublands and tussock grasslands like the shrublands between Okarito and Jackson Head. They are found to be basking in foliage like tussocks and shrubs; or they are found atop the vines and trees.</p>

    <div class="why">
      <h2>Why are Jewelled Geckos Endangered</h2>
      <p>The jewelled geckos are listed as "At Risk: Declining" by the Department of Conservation (DOC) and are mainly threatened by habitat loss, predation from pest mammals, and poaching.</p>
      <p>Habitat loss may be the result of changing land use for development, invasive or non-native plants and fires. The habitats of jewelled geckos are protected by the Wildlife Act and the Resource Management Act. However, the habitat of jewelled geckos are still lost as there are no reported sightings of these geckos on the land even though there may be some that are present. As a result, reported sightings of these geckos are important to the DOC to ensure that their habitat is not lost by accident.</p>
      <p>Another cause of the jewelled gecko's decline in numbers is the result of predation by pests. These include cats, ferrets, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs, mice and rats. This is because the gecko's rely on their camouflage and staying still to avoid detection which fails when the predator uses their keen sense of smell to detect the geckos. The arboreal members of the species are able to climb away from some of these predators, however they still face dangers from smaller and more nimble mammals that could climb. These would be cats, weasels, stoats, ferrets, rats and other small mammals capable of climbing trees.</p>
      <p>The third cause as to why these geckos are in decline is due to illegal collection of these geckos. They are targeted by smugglers to be sent overseas through illegal markets. To this day, 6 smugglers have been caught due to either hunting, possessing, smuggling or a mix of each.</p>

      <h2>Conservation of the geckos</h2>
      <p>There are ways to protect these geckos through various ways and one of those is through habitat preservation and land reclamation. Habitats can be preserved through cooperating with landowners by legal protection. To restore or reclaim lost land, native plant species can increase the existing area to allow more areas the geckos can thrive in. They can also be planted in wildlife corridors to allow two or more areas together which allows wildlife to move freely between the different habitats.</p>
