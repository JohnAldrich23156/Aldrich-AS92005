    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>This website is for my assessment which I have to create an environmental advisory page promoting Kaitiakitanga or Guardianship. I will use this website to promote conservation efforts and educate people about New Zealand's various Jewelled geckos species.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="why">
    <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
    <p>I am doing this to show that not only I can create a website using the things I learnt in class about HTML and CSS. But I can also create a website that promotes Kaitiakitanga and allowing others to be educated about endangered the Jewelled gecko species of New Zealand.</p>

    <h2>My Mission</h2>
    <p>My mission is to make this website for an assessment to show that I can create a website using what I learnt in class. It is also my mission to educate everyone in Mount Roskill Grammar School about the many endangered Jewelled gecko species of New Zealand. With my website, I will use it to share the idea of Kaitiakitanga in Mount Roskill Grammar School in relation to showing the endangered species of Jewelled geckos.</p>
