    <h2>The Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
    <p>The Jewelled geckos are a group of gecko species endemic to the south island of New Zealand in indigenous forests, shrublands, and tussock grasslands. The species are at risk and are in decline as listed in the New Zealand Herpetological Society. These geckos tend to be around 72-85mm SVL (Snout-Vent Length) with their tails being longer than their SVL. Some of these individuals can grow up to 90mm SVL with total lengths being recorded p to 187mm, although on average they grow up around 155-170mm. Jewelled geckos have a large population spread around in areas like Banks Peninsula, Canterbury Plains, South Canterbury, Mackenzie Country, regions in Otago and Foveaux Strait. With the very large population, there are also distinct features on the geckos native to that region with . A life span of a Jewelled gecko in the wilderness would have a minimum life expectancy of 14-15. With captive individuals however, the gecko's life expectancy increases to 20-25 years or potentially reach in excess of 35 years. The geckos are a terrestrial or arboreal species that inhabit indigenous forests shrublands and tussock grasslands. They are found to be basking in foliage like tussocks and shrubs, or they are atop the vines and trees.</p>
