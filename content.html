    <h2>Facts about Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Jewelled geckos have unique patterns on their skin which varies from each different species.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos give birth to live young unlike most other gecko species.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos have excellent climbing abilities due to the special construction of their toe pads and prehensile tails.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos are Diurnal, which means that they tend to spend most of their time during the day hours.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos are omnivorous, this means that their diet consists of invertebrates like insects, fruit and nectar.</li>

    <h2>The Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
    <p>The Jewelled geckos are a group of gecko species endemic to the south island of New Zealand in indigenous forests, shrublands, and tussock grasslands. These geckos tend to be around 72-85mm SVL (Snout-Vent Length) with their tails being longer than their SVL. Some of these individuals can grow up to 90mm SVL with total lengths being recorded p to 187mm, although on average they grow up around 155-170mm. Jewelled geckos have an omnivorous diet which consists of invertebrates like insects, honey, nectar and berries from Coprosma.</p>
    <p>Jewelled geckos have a large population spread around in areas like Banks Peninsula, Canterbury Plains, South Canterbury, Mackenzie Country, regions in Otago and Foveaux Strait. With a diverse population, there are also distinct features on the geckos native to that region with various coloured patterns (either yellow or white) outlined with black or dark brown lines. Some like those in Cantebury have a brown colour for their males with females having a grey-brown colouration on their sides.</p>
    <p>A life span of a Jewelled gecko in the wilderness would have a minimum life expectancy of 14-15. With captive individuals however, the gecko's life expectancy increases to 20-25 years and could even reach in excess of 35 years. The geckos are a terrestrial or arboreal species that inhabit indigenous forests like Beech forests, shrublands and tussock grasslands like the shrublands between Okarito and Jackson Head. They are found to be basking in foliage like tussocks and shrubs; or they are found atop the vines and trees.</p>

  <div class="why">
    <h2>Why are Jewelled Geckos Endangered</h2>
    <p>The jewelled geckos are listed as "At Risk: Declining" by the Department of Conservation (DOC) and are mainly threatened by habitat loss, predation from pest mammals, and poaching.</p>
    <p>Habitat loss may be the result of changing land use for development, invasive or non-native plants and fires. The habitats of jewelled geckos are protected by .</p>
