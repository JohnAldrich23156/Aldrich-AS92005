    <h2>About</h2>

  <div class="why">
    <h2>Why am I doing this?</h2>
    <p>I am doing this to show that not only I can create a website using the things I learnt in class about HTML and CSS. But I can also create a website that promotes Kaitiakitanga and allowing others to be educated about endangered the Jewelled gecko species of New Zealand.</p>
