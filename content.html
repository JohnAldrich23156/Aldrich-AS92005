    <h2>Facts about Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
      <li>Jewelled geckos have unique patterns on their skin which varies from each different species.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos give birth to live young unlike most other gecko species.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos have excellent climbing abilities due to the special construction of their toe pads and prehensile tails.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos are Diurnal, which means that they tend to spend most of their time during the day hours.</li>
      <li>Jewelled geckos are omnivorous, this means that their diet consists of invertebrates like insects, fruit and nectar.</li>

    <h2>The Jewelled Geckos:</h2>
    <p>The Jewelled geckos are a group of gecko species endemic to the south island of New Zealand in indigenous forests, shrublands, and tussock grasslands. These geckos tend to be around 72-85mm SVL (Snout-Vent Length) with their tails being longer than their SVL. Some of these individuals can grow up to 90mm SVL with total lengths being recorded p to 187mm, although on average they grow up around 155-170mm. Jewelled geckos have an omnivorous diet which consists of invertebrates like insects, honey, nectar and berries from Coprosma.</p>
    <p>Jewelled geckos have a large population spread around in areas like Banks Peninsula, Canterbury Plains, South Canterbury, Mackenzie Country, regions in Otago and Foveaux Strait. With a diverse population, there are also distinct features on the geckos native to that region with various coloured patterns (either yellow or white) outlined with black or dark brown lines. Some like those in Cantebury have a brown colour for their males with females having a grey-brown colouration on their sides.</p>
    <p>A life span of a Jewelled gecko in the wilderness would have a minimum life expectancy of 14-15. With captive individuals however, the gecko's life expectancy increases to 20-25 years and could even reach in excess of 35 years. The geckos are a terrestrial or arboreal species that inhabit indigenous forests like Beech forests, shrublands and tussock grasslands like the shrublands between Okarito and Jackson Head. They are found to be basking in foliage like tussocks and shrubs; or they are found atop the vines and trees.</p>

  <div class="why">
    <h2>Why are Jewelled Geckos Endangered</h2>
    <p>The jewelled geckos are listed as "At Risk: Declining" by the Department of Conservation (DOC) and are mainly threatened by habitat loss, predation from pest mammals, and poaching.</p>
    <p>Habitat loss may be the result of changing land use for development, invasive or non-native plants and fires. The habitats of jewelled geckos are protected by the Wildlife Act and the Resource Management Act. However, the habitat of jewelled geckos are still lost as there are no reported sightings of these geckos on the land even though there may be some that are present. As a result, reported sightings of these geckos are important to the DOC to ensure that their habitat is not lost by accident.</p>
    <p>Another cause of the jewelled gecko's decline in numbers is the result of predation by pests. These include cats, ferrets, stoats, weasels, hedgehogs, mice and rats. This is because the gecko's rely on their camouflage and staying still to avoid detection which fails when the predator uses their keen sense of smell to detect the geckos. The arboreal members of the species are able to climb away from some of these predators, however they still face dangers from smaller and more nimble mammals that could climb. These would be cats, weasels, stoats, ferrets, rats and other small mammals capable of climbing trees.</p>
    <p>The third cause as to why these geckos are in decline is due to illegal collection of these geckos. They are targeted by smugglers to be sent overseas through illegal markets from the Americas, Europe and Asia. To this day, 6 smugglers have been caught due to either hunting, possessing, smuggling or a mix of each.</p>

    <h2>Conservation of the geckos</h2>
    <p>There are ways to protect these geckos through various ways and one of those is through habitat preservation and land reclamation. Habitats can be preserved through cooperating with landowners by legal protection. To restore or reclaim lost land, native plant species can increase the existing area to allow more areas the geckos can thrive in. They can also be planted in wildlife corridors to allow two or more areas together which allows wildlife to move freely between the different habitats.</p>
    <p>Pest control is another way that these geckos are being protected. Controlling populations of predators using traps, poisoning and mammal-proof barriers to keep areas predator free. Vegetation can be managed through control grazing which prevents the predators to hide in the tall grass to allow them to ambush unsuspecting geckos. The geckos could also be relocated to a well protected area or a pest free island to repopulate or create new populations on the island. Communities can also be involved in conservation which also allows them to have awareness of the conservation of jewelled geckos. This can then allow other communities to participate in the conservation effort.</p>
    <p>There is also actions and consequences taken towards the illegal poaching, possession and or smuggling of jewelled geckos. These are done by CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) listings. To deal with poaching and illegal possession here in New Zealand, they are under protection of the Wildlife Act 1953 which results in heavy penalties when you commit these crimes. Smuggling can give you a maximum of five years in prison and or a $300,000 fine. Illegal possession will result in a penalty of up to $100,000 or imprisonment of up to 6 months. Poaching will result in a serious offence and as a result, you can get a fine up to $100,000 or up to two years of prison. There are many more fines on consequences for other sorts of offenses like infringement notices for minor offenses. For corporate bodies, they can receive up to $200,000 in fines for the same offenses listed.</p>
    <p>These are mainly enforced through the Department of Conservation and the Wildlife Enforcement group. The Wildlife Enforcement group is a collaboration with other bodies like Customs and the MPI to help with the enforcement and prevention of these wildlife crimes. The DOC is in charge of detecting and prevention of wildlife crime and maintains relations with the police to deal with enforcement when necessary. There are measures such as proactive detection, border control, internation cooperation, monitoring and public awareness.</p>

    To support the conservation efforts of jewelled geckos, you can raise awareness through others like how this website is being utilized for educating others about jewelled geckos. Donating or volunteering to organisations actively working on the conservation of jewelled geckos can help fund their organisation to further increase their efforts in the preservation of these geckos. If you're a pet owner, keep cats indoors to prevent them from geckos nearby especially if the place is known to have geckos nearby.
